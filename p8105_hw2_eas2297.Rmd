## Problem 1

First we need to read and clean the NYC transit data, while also retaining only the necessary variables and converting the _entry_ variable from character to logical:

```{r}
subway_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```
